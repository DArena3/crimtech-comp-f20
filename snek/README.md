# Snek
Work in progress.

## Setting Up
1. `pip install pygame`
2. Terminal text editor. I recommend `micro`, which can be installed with `curl https://getmic.ro | bash` and then `mv micro /usr/bin`.
3. Code editor. I recommend (VSCode)[https://code.visualstudio.com/].
3. Windows people need to get xserver to load the Snake. Alternatively, they can get python for windows. This is a one-time thing...
